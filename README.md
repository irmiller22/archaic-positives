### What is Archaic Positives?

This is my (Ian Miller) personal website. It's still a work in progress, but slowly getting there. Simply put, it will be a reference point for several things:
  - Blog
  - Work Details
  - Interests
  - Contact

### Priority List:

  * Blog
    - Figure out how design will be implemented
    - Still working under octopress?
  * Work Details
    - What will serve as images for each work detail?
    - Logos? Project Names?
  * Interests
    - Have three area of interests (like on old site)
    - Favorite quotes (Bruce Feiler, etc)
  * Contact
    - Set up contact form
    - Equivalent of mailer for sinatra?

### Feature Pipeline:
  * Instagram Feed
  * Tweet Feed (plugin currently not working)
  * Front-end design implementation for blog
