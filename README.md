## What is Archaic Positives?

This is my (Ian Miller) personal website. It's still a work in progress, but slowly getting there. Simply put, it will be a reference point for several things:
  - Blog
  - Work Details
  - Interests
  - Contact

## Priority List:

  * Blog
    - Currently namespaced under `blog.ianmiller.nyc`
    - Add updater that will add new posts to ianmiller.nyc

## Feature Pipeline:
  * Instagram Feed
  * Front-end design implementation for blog
